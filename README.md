# Databases-Project
## Description
This project is written purely in SQL which creates an sql hr, invoicing, store, and inventory database with each database consisting of multiple tables and also contains a bunch of SQL queries for the set of databases
## Repository Structure
The Repository Directory Structure consists of these elements
- "create-databases.sql" file which creates all 4 databases (hr, invoicing, store, and inventory) in 1 run 
- "Create_Database" folder which contains 4 files with each file creating 1 out of the 4 databases listed above in the case that the MySQL workbench doesn't create all 4 databases when using the "create-databases.sql" file
- "Queries" folder which includes a myriad of SQL queries for each database
## Testing
Steps to run the project:
1. Download a software called "MySQL Workbench", in the process it should prompt the developer to create an account 
2. Log into the MySQL Server with the correct username and password
3. Once you get into the program, open up on of the "create-database" files
4. Execute one of the "create-database" files, by clicking on the lightning icon
5. Refresh the "SCHEMAS" section to generate the database that was just created
6. If the developer wants to execute a query, then open up a query file and execute it
